assemver
========
Would like to create something that is capable of scanning assembly (-ies) to validate that there are no 
breaking changes from on assembly to a later change in the assembly.  Ultimately I would like to be able to 
create profiles for the analysis (semver etcâ€¦).   The idea that I have right now is something that could enter 
the continuous integration process and possibly fail/warn a build if versioning rules have been broken.
